Code used to solve all of the problems given in:

Phelan, Thomas, and Keyvan Eslami. "Applications of markov chain approximation methods to optimal control problems in economics." Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control (2022): 104437.

Since publication I have fixed several bugs in the original code as described in errata.pdf. None affect the main results or figures in the paper but change run times slightly. For the original code see the archived repository located at: https://github.com/tphelanECON/EslamiPhelan_JEDC_2022.
